# CSC699-Lexical-Text-Similarity
A lexical text similarity program that serves as the basis of exploration for various performance metrics. 

## Description

This project implements a lexical text similarity algorithm which is used as the basis for exploration of performance analysis topics. The initial commits will implement a naive and unoptimized version of this algorithm. Subsequent commits will contain various changes aimed at improving the overall performance characteristics of the algorithm based on measurements and profiling data taken at each phase.
